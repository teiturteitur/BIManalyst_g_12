## Summary of feedback on our tool

Overall, the feedback on our tool was very positive. The other groups found it useful and liked the clarity provided in the README and the video we included. At the same time, they also pointed out areas where the tool could be expanded or improved in the future. 

One point was, that our tool currently assumes all existing psets in the IFC model to be correct. The suggestion was to add a check that compares the existing pset values for the airflow with the airflow calculated in the script. If the match is too large, the script could flag this as an issue and add it to the BCF file. This would add a layer of quality check and make the tool more robust.

Another comment suggested that we might consider adding the pressure loss results to the BCF issues. At this point, the pressure loss is calculated but not used to create issues. Making it a part of the BCF file could help engineers with understanding where critical pressure loss occur in the model. 

We also received suggestions about expanding the tool to handle flowsegments or pipes, which could make the tool applicable beyond ventilation systems.
