## Summary of feedback on our tool

Overall, the feedback on our tool was very positive. The other groups found it useful and liked the clarity provided in the README and the video we included. At the same time, they also pointed out areas where the tool could be expanded or improved in the future. 

One point was, that our tool currently assumes all existing psets in the IFC model to be correct. The suggestion was to add a check that compares the existing pset values for the airflow with the airflow calculated in the script. If the match is too large, the script could flag this as an issue and add it to the BCF file. This would add a layer of quality check and make the tool more robust.

Another comment suggested that we might consider adding the pressure loss results to the BCF issues. At this point, the pressure loss is calculated but not used to create issues. Making it a part of the BCF file could help engineers with understanding where critical pressure loss occur in the model. 

We also received suggestions about expanding the tool to handle flowsegments or pipes, which could make the tool applicable beyond ventilation systems.

### Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.

At the beginning of the course I would describe myself mainly as a modeller, with focus on making a building look correct within a BIM software. Now, after working with IFC data and scripting, I have gotten insights into how much values the underlying data and information in the BIM models have, and how in can be used for analysis and validation. I would therefore now identify myself as more of an analyst than a modeller. 

There is still a lot I need to learn, especially when it comes to creating more advanced scripts, handling complex IFC files and understanding larger BIM workflows. I also want to develop a better overview of how to structure tools better so they are more scalable and easier to maintain. But I can see, that with more practice, and the right idea or use case, I would be able to create tools that makes BIM workflows more effective and efficient. 

In the future, I would like to use BIM more actively to check models in the process, as it can save a lot of time and reduce errors, both in my own work and hen receiving models from others. 

### Your process of developing the tutorial

**Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?**

**Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?**

**Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?**



### Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

**are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?**

**are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?**
